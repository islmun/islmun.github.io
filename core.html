				<center><h2 class="">MUN is a platform for young adults to engage within a professional network of delegates originating from all around the world when dealing with issues of global importance and peaceful solutions to them.</h2></center>
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Therefore, at ISLMUN Chairs are trained to focus significantly upon a professional conduct of debate, ensuring that Delegate experience is not only beneficial in terms of skills, but also for meaningful networking purposes. That said however, the maintenance of a professional environment cannot be ensured with inappropriate distractions, and that is why at ISLMUN, note passing is strictly for professional purposes only.

				<center><h2 class="">The importance of complete and productive debate is paramount to the success of any MUN conference.</h2></center>
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> As a result, ISLMUN employs procedures very similar to those utilized at other conferences in Qatar, following most of the procedures established by the THIMUN foundation. Nevertheless, right to follow up is permitted at ISLMUN, allowing delegates to engage in productive and relevant debate at all times during committee sessions

				<center><h2 class="">The Security Council is a platform for the resolution and enforcement of the most pressing global issues, requiring the highest levels of professionalism from Delegates and Student Officers alike, as well as strict adherence to international conventions.</h2></center>
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Because of this, Expert Chairs for Security Council issues have the right to veto a clause during the conference, but this is only permissible if said clause directly violates the sovereignty of a state not represented in the council, and if this violation, as well as any possible diversion from international conventions, has not been recognized by the present members of the council.
