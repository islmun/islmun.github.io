					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Greetings Distinguished Directors, Esteemed Guests, Honorable Delegates and Student Officers;
					<br />
					<br />
					It is an honor for me to welcome you to the ISLMUN web page. Throughout the exploration of this website, you can find all relevant information pertaining to our upcoming, Fourth Annual ISLMUN Conference, ranging from schedules to issues, procedures and committee reports, as well as many other areas. The inclusion of helpful sample material allows both new, aspiring Delegates and experienced Delegates alike to be able to prepare for the two-day conference thoroughly, ensuring that their research allows them to make meaningful and worthwhile contributions to resolution drafting and debate. As always however, if any questions arise, please do not hesitate to address any queries to either myself or our MUN director through contact information included in the ‘Contact Us’ section.
					<br />
					<br />
					Our conference is aimed at satisfying the needs of delegates of all experience levels, providing a high quality and stimulating Model United Nations experience in the process. The conference procedures recognize the need for extensive debate, as well as for the maintenance of a parliamentary environment in committees and adhering to international conventions during resolution drafting. Student Officers at ISLMUN are trained to ensure that committees are ran professionally, with integrity, as well as focus on objective debate.
					<br />
					<br />
					In my opinion, MUN is an excellent activity for High School Students to take part in. Not only does it equip students with the skills of diplomacy, research and professionalism – it also prepares our generation, the leaders of tomorrow, with the necessary international awareness needed to make a difference in an increasingly globalized world. By attending an MUN conference, students bolster these skills, making meaningful and worthwhile professional connections for the future in the process. In the words of the former UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon:
					<br />
					<br />
					<center><p class="coolio"><i>“By strengthening the three pillars of the United Nations - security, development and human rights - we can build a more peaceful, more prosperous and more just world for our succeeding generations.” </i></p></center>
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
					<br />
					<br />
					At ISLMUN, we strive to provide an MUN experience that would prepare future leaders to do just that. To develop and enforce universal human rights. To maintain and improve international security. To accelerate effective development and meet the Sustainable Development Goals. Not because participation in MUN will benefit them as individuals – but because the impact it has on them can in turn provide a positive impact for millions.
					<br />
					<br />
					Please allow me to say that I am greatly looking forward for seeing you at the Fourth Annual ISLMUN conference. Issues discussed over these two days in January will provide meaningful insights into pressing issues of global importance, allowing students to not only grow as diplomats, but as citizens of a one, common world, as well. ISLMUN 2018 will be a worthwhile use of your time.
					<br />
					<br />
					Best Regards,
					<br />
					<br />
					Jan Sedlacek
					Secretary General, ISLMUN 2018
