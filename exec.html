			    <p>Jan Sedláček| Secretary General</p>
			    <img src="Images/jan.jpg" alt="Jan" style="width:80%">
			    <p>Greetings Distinguished Delegates, Honorable Student Officers, Esteemed Directors and Guests,
			    <br />
				My name is Jan Sedláček and this year, I have the absolute honor of serving as the Secretary General for the Fourth Annual ISLMUN Conference. My MUN journey started almost three years ago, in late 2015, when I joined the MUN club as a complete stranger to the idea of ever attending a conference. Yet after a few sessions, I was hooked, and have since taken part in 15 conferences. Being a Delegate of countries ranging from Chad to the United Kingdom, repeatedly chairing Security Council at local and international conferences and serving as the President for the Third Annual ISLMUN conference, my passion and enthusiasm for MUN has grown by the minute and now, I am reaching perhaps the pinnacle of my MUN journey. I feel that MUN is something very important for high school students to experience, because not only does it expand on critical thinking, negotiation and public speaking skills, it also prepares students for the challenging task of being the agents of change of tomorrow. Taking upon the role of a delegate and representing a country different to your own broadens your awareness of global issues, understanding of various policies, but it also provides a unique perspective on global cultural, political, economic and social interactions, which is something paramount that leaders of an increasingly globalized world will require. As part of this conference, my role is to coordinate most of the planning processes and then make sure that everybody performs their roles accordingly on the conference days. I also work alongside the remainder of the Big 4 to ensure that all content and logistics related matters are carried out well and on time. My personal goal is to make sure that ISLMUN continues growing and becomes one of the major conferences in Qatar that delegates from all around the country will want to attend, as well as that their experience is a professional and an unforgettable one.
				<br />
				I am looking forward for seeing you at the conference!

			    <img src="Images/abdulla.jpg" alt="Abdulla" style="width:80%">
			    <p>Why, hello there!
			    	<br />
					My name’s Abdulla Al-Rumaihi and I’ll be your Deputy Secretary General for ISLMUN ’18. I’ve been doing MUN for the past 3 years as a delegate and Head of Admin for our conference last year. 
					<br />
					I believe MUN everyone should do MUN because of its ability to develop people both academically and socially. It introduces you to topics you might not necessarily have heard of in school or through your own reading, and it forces you to think critically and through various perspectives. It also allows you to interact with new people and develop your negotiation and social skills, both vitally important for all your future endeavors. 
					<br />
					As DSG, I will be aiding the Secretary General and Head of Admin in overseeing and ensuring logistical perfection, and making this experience as stress-free and enjoyable for everyone. For first-timers, I hope we can provide you with an experience you can cherish forever; for returning delegates, I hope to hear fruitful, engaging debates. 
					<br />
					Peace. 
					<br />
